This file reports several soil chemistry properties of soil samples collected at 25 cm soil depth at points located on a regular 10X25 grid with a 5 meter spacing.
The dataset contains 250 observations and 22 variables.

The variables in the file are:

x: the x coordinate or coordinate of the point along the horizontal axis 
y: the y coordinate of coordinate of the point along the vertical axis
elevation: the elevation of the point
sand: the percentage of sand in the sample 
silt: the percentage of silt in the sample
clay: the percentage of clay in the sample
pH_water: the pH of water in the sample
pH_KCl: the pH of potassium chloride in the sample
calcium: the amount of calcium in the sample
magnesium: the amount of magnesium in the sample
potassium: the amount of potassium in the sample
aluminum: the amount of aluminum in the sample
hydrogen: the amount of hydrogen in the sample
carbon: the amount of carbon in the sample
nitrogen: the amount of nitrogen in the sample
cation_exchange: the cation exchange capacity in the sample
sulfur: the amount of sulfur in the sample
volume: volume of the sample
mass: mass of the sample
NC: amount of NC in the sample
CEC: cation exchange capacity of the sample
CN: carbon/nitrogen ratio in the sample
